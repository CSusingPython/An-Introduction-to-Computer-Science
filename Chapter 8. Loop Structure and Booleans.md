## Chapter 8. Loop Structure and Booleans

### 1. For loops
* Strueture
```
for <var> in <sequences>:
    <body>
```

### 2. Indefinite loops
* Structure
```
while <condition>: 
    <body>
```
* Infinite loop

### 3. Common loop patterns
* Interactive loops: allows the user to repeat certain portions of a program on demand.
* Sential loops: continues to process data until reaching a special value that signals the end.
* File loops
* Nested loops

### 4. Computing with booleans
* Boolean operator: '=='
```
<expr> and <expr>
<expr> or <expr>
```
* Boolean algebra

### 5. Other common structure
* Post-test loop: ex) input validation
* Loop and a half: loop exit is actually in the middle of the loop body.
* The logic of a loop is easily lost when there are multiple exits.
* Error case: 'while response[O] == "y" or "Y":'
* Python's Boolean operators are shortcircuit operators.

### 6. Example
* Modal input: lock the user into a certain mode of interaction. <-> nonmodal(multimodal)
