(개요)
- Object-Oriented Programming vs. procedural programming
- class = form or questionnaire vs. instance(object) = answered questionnaire

(해석) 
- 그래픽에서 point, circle 등은 object이고, 그래픽은 class이고, 관계로 보면 point, circle 등은 class의 instance가 됨. 
- point.draw(win)에서 draw는 point의 method이며, win은 arguments가 됨.      

(기타) 
- 아래 (예시)에서, Dog를 Class를 정의하는 것처럼 쓴 것 보이는데, 아래 Class Attribute에서 상위범주를 mammal로 했다면,
mammal이 class가 되고, Dog가 instance가 되는 것인지?

(예시)
class Dog:

    # Class Attribute   
    species = 'mammal'   

    # Initializer / Instance Attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

•What Is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
objects are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.

•Classes in Python
class just provides structure—it’s a blueprint for how something should be defined, but it doesn’t actually provide any real content itself. The Animal() class may specify that the name and age are necessary for defining an animal, but it will not actually state what a specific animal’s name or age is.

•Python Objects (Instances)
While the class is the blueprint, an instance is a copy of the class with actual values, literally an object belonging to a specific class. It’s not an idea anymore; it’s an actual animal, like a dog named Roger who’s eight years old.
Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. It defines the needed information. After you fill out the form, your specific copy is an instance of the class; it contains actual information relevant to you.

•How To Define a Class in Python 
class Dog:
    pass

◦Instance Attributes
class Dog:

    # Initializer / Instance Attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

◦Class Attributes
class Dog:

    # Class Attribute
    species = 'mammal'

    # Initializer / Instance Attributes
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

•Instantiating Objects 
when you create a new instance of the class, Python automatically determines what self is (a Dog in this case) and passes it to the __init__ method.
